# MoodleScrape
A Python3 script to pull all downloadable files from RGU Moodle pages

MoodleScrape is designed to make life a little bit easier for Robert Gordon University students and staff.

MoodleScrape is a small CLI Program that requires the Moodle username, password and module link to pull data from. It can identify most file extentions using the mimetypes package. This implementation is not perfect at identifying files but covers the core file types nicely(Micorsoft Office extentions, PDFs)

This project could be adapted to allow for a more general solution and allow other Moodle portals to be accessed in the same way, but because RGU is the University I attended this is the solution provided.

MoodleScrape is a personal project, and is not affiliated with Moodle or Robert Gordon University in any way other than being developed by an RGU Alumini. The repository will not be updated regularly, therefore I suggest that if you would like to make changes to the code, forking would be the better option.
